This application is a small portable tool. It uses a third-party library for Base64 computations.

The `Compare MD5` option is experimental and will compare the MD5 encoded result between two different units included in Delphi, one of which is part of the Indy10 library.

**Features:**
- Encrypt/decrypt a string to/from Base64.
- Encrypt tp MD5.
